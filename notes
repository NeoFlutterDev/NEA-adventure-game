The screen is divided into 5184 seperate sections called quadrants. Each quadrant is 1/54 of the height by 1/96 of the length. This makes each quadrant a 20x20 square.
The first quadrant is the top left, and it works rightwards, once it hits the end of the screen the next quadrant is the row below, on the left side.
The base sprite size will be based upon the standard 1920x1080 aspect ratio. A scaling factor is determined to alter the size of sprites if the size of the screen is not the same.

Every time the mouse is clicked the game will determine what quadrant the mouse is in
Each button will inhabit certain quadrants, and when the mouse presses in that quadrant, in a specific screen, it will be activated
